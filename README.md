# UPDATE:
30 March 2023: Quora Poe has updated their mail filter, so the auto login feature by Guerrilla Mail as temporary email service is not working anymore. I will try to find another temporary email service to replace it.

# Quora Poe
This is a tool to call the Quora Poe API through GraphQL. It is a work in progress, and currently supports the following:
- Auto login using temporary email, so you don't need to use your own email/phone number.
- Manual login using your own email/phone number, you need to enter the OTP manually.
- Chat with 4 types of bots (Sage, Claude, ChatGPT, and Dragonfly).
- Stream responses support from the bot.
- Clear the chat history.
- Auto re-login after session expires (only for auto login).
- Module support, now you can use this tool as a module.
- Chat history 
- Prompt from file
- Delete messages

## Requirements
- NodeJS 16.0.0 or higher
- NPM

## Installation
- Copy the config.example.json file to config.json
- Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Usage
### Module
Please see file [`./src/client_auto.ts`](./src/client_auto.ts) or [`./src/client_manual.ts`](./src/client_manual.ts) for example.
Or you can try to run the following command:
```
node ./dist/client_auto.js
```
### CLI
```
npm run cli
```
If you don't want stream responses, you can change the `stream_response` variable in the `config.json` file to `false`.

## TODO List
